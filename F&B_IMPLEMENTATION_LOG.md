## Implementation Progress

### Status: Started
**Date**: 2025-06-28  
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation Extension

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Extension (Weeks 1-3)

### 1.1 Project Setup & Configuration ✅ COMPLETED

**Completed Actions:**
- ✅ Installed dependencies with `pnpm install` (after installing pnpm globally)
- ✅ Copied environment configuration: `cp .env.example .env.local`
- ✅ Configured environment variables for Saleor Cloud endpoint

**Commands Executed:**
```bash
npm install -g pnpm@10.12.1  # Installed pnpm as specified in package.json
pnpm install                  # Installed 918 packages successfully
cp .env.example .env.local    # Created local environment file
# Added F&B specific configuration: https://store-4bpwsmd6.saleor.cloud/graphql/
```

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Environment Ready**: Development environment set up and ready for F&B implementation  
**Next Steps**: Begin GraphQL schema extensions

### 1.2 Saleor Schema Extensions ✅ COMPLETED

**Completed Actions:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive F&B GraphQL operations adapted to Saleor's schema
- ✅ Fixed all 23 GraphQL validation errors through systematic debugging
- ✅ Successfully generated TypeScript types for F&B operations
- ✅ Leveraged Saleor's Channel system for multi-restaurant management
- ✅ Used metadata system for custom F&B data storage
- ✅ Created working restaurant order management workflows

**Final Working Files:**
```
graphql/
├── queries/
│   ├── restaurants-revised.graphql     ✅ Working (Channels-based restaurants)
│   └── orders-restaurant.graphql       ✅ Working (Restaurant order queue)
└── mutations/
    └── restaurant-orders.graphql       ✅ Working (Order lifecycle management)
```

**GraphQL Fix Summary:**
- 🔧 **23 → 0 errors**: Systematic fix of all validation errors
- 🔧 **Channel Usage**: Leveraged `channels` query for restaurant management  
- 🔧 **Order Management**: Fixed filter syntax and event field access
- 🔧 **Metadata Operations**: Corrected `updatePrivateMetadata` usage with inline fragments

**Status**: ✅ Completed - All GraphQL operations working and types generated  
**Key Success**: Adapted F&B requirements to work with existing Saleor capabilities  
**Ready For**: Phase 1.3 - Enhanced Webhook System Implementation

**Technical Achievements:**
- Restaurant management via Saleor Channels with metadata for F&B-specific data

- 🔍 **Key Discovery**: Base Saleor schema provides ~80-85% of F&B functionality through Channels, Products, Orders, and Metadata
- 📋 **Strategy Pivot**: Leveraging existing Saleor capabilities instead of custom schema extensions
- 🔧 Created working GraphQL files adapted to Saleor's schema (restaurants-revised.graphql, orders-restaurant.graphql, restaurant-orders.graphql)
- ⚠️ Still fixing validation errors in GraphQL operations - 23 errors remaining
- 📚 Documented comprehensive analysis of Saleor schema capabilities for F&B use cases
- 🎯 **Next**: Complete GraphQL fixes and move to webhook implementation (Phase 1.3)

**Progress**: 1.5/6 phases completed, currently fixing GraphQL validation issues before proceeding to webhooks.
