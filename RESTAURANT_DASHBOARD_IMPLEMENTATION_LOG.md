### [10:45 AM] Testing & Bug Fixes - Started

**TypeScript Compilation Issues Fixed:**
- Fixed Material-UI imports - replaced with Saleor Macaw UI components
- Updated Modal component usage - changed onClose to onChange prop
- Fixed color prop values for Text components (error‚Üícritical1, text2‚Üídefault2, brand‚Üíaccent1)
- Fixed grid prop type error - changed gridTemplateColumns string to numeric value
- Fixed ReactNode type errors - wrapped metadata values with String() conversion
- Fixed OrderStatusTracker unknown type error - changed logical AND to ternary operator
- Fixed ESLint unescaped entity error - escaped apostrophe in "Today&apos;s Revenue"
- Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (restaurant dashboard specific errors)

**Remaining Issues:**
- Some GraphQL schema mismatches in other files (not critical for dashboard)
