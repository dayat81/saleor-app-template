## Implementation Progress Log

### Session Start: 2025-06-28
**Objective**: Execute Phase 2.1 implementation plan
**Dependencies**: ✅ Phase 1 complete (GraphQL operations, webhooks, authentication)
**Foundation**: All backend infrastructure ready

### Day 1 Tasks:
1. ✅ **Create Main Dashboard Page** - `restaurant-dashboard.tsx`
2. ✅ **Implement Channel Selector** - Multi-restaurant switching component
3. ✅ **Set up Dashboard API** - Backend endpoint for dashboard data
4. ✅ **Basic Layout Structure** - Foundation for restaurant interface

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Authentication Strategy
Using proven patterns from Phase 1:
- Basic Auth (admin:admin) for public operations
- Basic Auth + Saleor-App-Token for admin operations
- Channel specification: "default-channel" for operations

### GraphQL Integration
Leveraging existing working operations:
- `RestaurantListsDocument` - For channel/restaurant data
- `RestaurantOrderQueueDocument` - For order queue display
- `AcceptRestaurantOrderDocument` - For order management actions

### Architecture Approach
- Building React components that integrate with existing Saleor App Template
- Using URQL client already configured in the template
- Metadata-based storage for F&B-specific restaurant data
- Real-time updates via polling (WebSocket upgrade planned for Phase 3)
